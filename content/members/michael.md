Hi, I'm Michael Liu, the President and Founding Member of the West Morris High School Anime Club! ^\_\_\_^ I run the club meetings and am Webmaster of this club website. In addition to my club duties, I perform as Bob, the mascot of the Morris High Bobcats. GO CATS!!! 

I bet you can't guess what my favorite anime is. \*Looks around\* Oh wait maybe you can. XD I also have a fursona I'm developing. He's still a work in progress though so don't judge him too harshly. ^^;; I also have a passion for writing and am developing various fan fiction stories that I'm going to post here! Eventually. When I get around to it. >\_>()
