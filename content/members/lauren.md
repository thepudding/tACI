Konnichiwa! ^\_^ I'm Lauren, a 16-year-old girl who has been enjoying anime and manga since 6th grade, starting with my first love, Bishoujo Senshi Sailormoon. I don't watch as much anime as I read manga. (ever since I realized I could buy 3-4 manga titles for the price of one DVD X3; )

With the magical powers of the internet, however, sampling new anime is made easier and I don't mind suggestions--as long as you glance at my Anime List to make sure its in my tastes.

I love drawing and hope to become a mangaka one day! Here are some of my drawings. Please go easy on me, I'm still learning! >.<;;
