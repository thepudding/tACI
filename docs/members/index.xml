      <description>Konnichiwa! ^_^ I&amp;rsquo;m Lauren, a 16-year-old girl who has been enjoying anime and manga since 6th grade, starting with my first love, Bishoujo Senshi Sailormoon. I don&amp;rsquo;t watch as much anime as I read manga. (ever since I realized I could buy 3-4 manga titles for the price of one DVD X3; )
With the magical powers of the internet, however, sampling new anime is made easier and I don&amp;rsquo;t mind suggestions&amp;ndash;as long as you glance at my Anime List to make sure its in my tastes.</description>

      <description>Hello, my name is Jeffery Miller and have been the Secretary of the West Morris High Anime Club since it was founded by my longtime friend, Michael Liu, in mid 2005. I have been an enthusiast of Japanese animation for many years, and my favorite anime films and television shows include Akira, Ghost in the Shell, and Perfect Blue. In addition to anime, my interests include speech and debate, foreign lanuages, aviation, track and field, and radio technology.</description>
